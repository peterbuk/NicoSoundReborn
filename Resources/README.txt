Nico Sound Reborn
Version 1.1
Author: Eternith
-----------------

This small utility lets you rip an MP3 track from a given NicoNicoDouga link.

Just run NicoSoundReborn.exe and follow the prompts to insert a NND URL 
and the file name for the resulting mp3 track (default will be song.mp3).

Current issues:
- Does not check for valid URL.
- No MP3 tagging or automatic file naming from source
- Only tested with NND, although one of the utilities should work with other vid sites.
- Really big file size due to necessary components.

But it works! (RIP Nicosound)
