Nico Sound Reborn
Version 1.2
Author: Peter Buk
-----------------

This small utility lets you rip an MP3 track from a given NicoNicoDouga link.

Just run NicoSoundReborn.exe and fill in the text boxes with the appropriate fields.

Current issues:
- The tag automatic parsing is currently very basic and only uses the video name for all tags.
- Current implementation is just a GUI wrapper for a script. Will need to redirect progress output better.
- Really big file size due to necessary components.

Open source components:

RIP Nicosound.
